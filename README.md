üß† AI-Powered Utility Suite
A comprehensive project combining multiple AI-driven tools to simplify tasks like PDF summarization, translation, YouTube content creation, and more. This suite is built with OpenAI's GPT models, LangChain, and Streamlit/Gradio to empower users with cutting-edge AI capabilities.

üöÄ Features
1. YouTube Content Generator
Generate compelling YouTube video titles and scripts based on a given topic.

Input: Topic prompt.
Output: AI-generated video title and script, leveraging Wikipedia research for enhanced context.
Framework: Streamlit.
2. Language Translator
Translate text or entire PDFs into diverse languages.

Input: Text or PDF file and target language.
Output: Translated text or file in the desired language.
Framework: Gradio.
3. PDF Summarizer
Extract and summarize key insights from PDFs.

Input: PDF file path.
Output: Concise AI-generated summary saved as a .txt file.
Frameworks: Gradio & CLI (Command Line Interface).
4. Standalone PDF Summarization Script
A simpler implementation of the summarizer for direct use with no GUI.

üìã How It Works
YouTube Content Generator
Input a topic into the Streamlit app.
Generates:
A YouTube video title based on the topic.
A video script using additional research from Wikipedia.
Output includes a history of titles, scripts, and research results.
Language Translator
Enter the text or upload a PDF in the Gradio app.
Specify the language you want the content translated into.
View and download translated results.
PDF Summarizer
Input a PDF file path into the app or script.
The tool processes each page, generates summaries using GPT, and outputs a .txt file.
